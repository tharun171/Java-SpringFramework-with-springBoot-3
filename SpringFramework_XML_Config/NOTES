

By Default, spring framework follows Singleton Object creation pattern

Only one Object is created and its instances are shared


SETTER INJECTION
CONSTRUCTOR INJECTION - name,index,type(if all datatypes are unique)
- in constructor injection, we can follow same order of arguments as in constructor
AUTOWIRE TYPES - byName,byType

to remove ambiguity while using byType
when we have 2 beans of same type
we can resolve it using primary=true to wanted bean
This bean will be binded

LAZY-init = true
object will be created when we ask for it.
